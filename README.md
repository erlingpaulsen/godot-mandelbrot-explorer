# Mandelbrot Fractal Explorer
This is a shader based program for exploring the Mandelbrot fractal. Various shader parameters are exposed and can be tweaked for interesting and novel visual effects. It also supports saving/loading presets, and saving images.

The project was created in Godot 4.3, but works as expected with 4.4 as well.
